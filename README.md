In this project we will build a chatbot using Amazon Lex, exploring intents, utterances, slots, and fulfillment, and integrated it with Amazon Connect to handle both voice and chat interactions via configured flows, communication widgets, and static web deployment on Amazon S3 and CloudFront. The system included configuring telephony, access settings, customer input blocks, success/error handling, and linking Connect flows to phone numbers and web chat widgets. After successful testing via the deployed website, all resources were systematically deleted to avoid costs.

# Activity Guide

3. Host and Test the Bot on a Static Website (Amazon S3, CloudFront, Amazon Connect)
- Host a static website using an S3 bucket and create a CloudFront distribution for HTTPS access.
- Embed the communication widget in the website, provide the URL to Amazon Connect, and test the bot.

4. Add Communication Features to Enhance Interaction (Amazon Connect)
